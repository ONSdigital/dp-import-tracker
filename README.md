DP Import Tracker
=================

Check for completed import instances, and mark them (and possibly
their associated/parent import job) as completed.

* At startup, ask the Dataset API for the list of active instances.

* Add to the above in-memory list when `INPUT_FILE_AVAILABLE_TOPIC` events arrive.

* Also, listen for `IMPORT_OBSERVATIONS_INSERTED_TOPIC` events,
and inform the Dataset API with those additional numbers of inserted observations.

* Regularly check the [Dataset API](../dp-dataset-api) for the total number of observations,
and the current count of inserted observations.  When the total has been
inserted, mark the **status** of the instance as `completed` (and similar
for the parent import job, if all other instances are also `completed`).

`INPUT_FILE_AVAILABLE_TOPIC` events are published by the [Import API](../dp-import-api).

`IMPORT_OBSERVATIONS_INSERTED_TOPIC` events are published by the
[Observation Importer](../dp-observation-importer).

### Getting started

Service is authenticated against `zebedee`, one can run [dp-auth-api-stub](https://github.com/ONSdigital/dp-auth-api-stub) to mimic
service identity check in zebedee.
`make debug`
